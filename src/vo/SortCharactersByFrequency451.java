/**
 * 451. Sort Characters By frequency
 * 
 * - Given a string s, sort it in decreasing order based on the frequency of the characters.
 * - return the sorted string.
 * - If there are multiple answers, return any of them.
 * 
 * Input: s = "tree"
 * Output: "eert"
 * Explanation: 'e' appears twice while 'r' and 't' both appear once.
 * So 'e' must appear before both 'r' and 't'. Therefore "eetr" is also a valid answer.
 * 
 * Approach : HashMap + sort
 * 
 * Intuition:
 * - Another approach is to use a HashMap to count how many times each character occurs in the string;
 *   the keys are the characters and the values are frequencies.
 * - Next, extract a copy of the keys from the HashMap and sort them by frequency using a Comparator
 *   that looks a the hashMap values to make its decisions.
 * - Finally, initialise a new StringBuilder and then iterate over the list of sorted characters(sorted by frequency).
 * - Look up the values in the HashMap to know how many of each character to append to the StringBuilder.

/**
 * Complexity Analysis: 
 *
 *   - Let n be the length of the input String and k be the number of unique characters in the String.
 *
 *   - We know that k â‰¤ n, because there can't be more unique characters than there are characters in the String. 
 *   - We also know that k is somewhat bounded by the fact that there's only a finite number of characters in Unicode (or ASCII, which I suspect is all we need to worry about for this question).
 *
 *   - There are two ways of approaching the complexity analysis for this question.
 *
 *   - We can disregard k, and consider that in the worst case, k = n.
 *   - We can consider k, recognising that the number of unique characters is not infinite. This is more accurate for real world purposes.
 *   - I've provided analysis for both ways of approaching it. I choose not to bring it up for the previous approach, because it made no difference there.
 *
 *
 * - Time Complexity : O(nlogn) OR O(n+klogk).
 *
 *   - Putting the characters into the HashMap has a cost of O(n), because each of the n characters must be put in, and putting each in is an O(1) operation.
 *   - Sorting the HashMap keys has a cost of O(klogk), because there are k keys, and this is the standard cost for sorting. If only using n, then it's O(nlogn). For the previous question, the sort was carried out on n items, not k, so was possibly a lot worse.
 *   - Traversing over the sorted keys and building the String has a cost of O(n), as n characters must be inserted.
 *   - Therefore, if we're only considering n, then the final cost is O(nlogn).
 *   - Considering k as well gives us O(n+klogk), because we don't know which is largest out of n and klogk. We do, however, know that in total this is less than or equal to O(nlogn).
 *
 * - Space Complexity : O(n).
 *
 *   - The HashMap uses O(k) space.
 *   - However, the StringBuilder at the end dominates the space complexity, pushing it up to O(n), as every character from the input String must go into it. Like was said above, it's impossible to do better with the space complexity here.
 *   - What's interesting here is that if we only consider n, the time complexity is the same as the previous approach. But by considering k, we can see that the difference is potentially substantial.
