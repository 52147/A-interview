/**
 * 
 * 103. Binary Tree Zigzag Level Order Traversal
 * 
 * - Given the root of a binary tree,
 *   return the zigzag level order traversal of its nodes's values.
 *   
 *   Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
 *   Output: [[3],[20,9],[15,7]]
 *   
 * Approach: BFS
 * 
 * - implement bfs with a single loop.
 * - the trick is that we append the nodes be visited into a queue
 *   and we separate nodes of different levels with a sort of delimiter (e.g. an empty node).
 * - The delimiter marks the end of a level, as well as the beginning of a new level.
 * 
 * - For each level, we start from an empty deque container to hold all the values of the same level.
 * - Depending on the ordering of each level, i.e. either from-left-to-right or from-right-to-left,
 *   we decide at which end of the deque to add the new element.
 *   
 *   
 *   - For the ordering of from-left-to-right(FIFO),
 *     we append the new element to the tail of the queue, 
 *     so that the element that comes late would get out late as well.
 *   - given an input sequence of [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], with FIFO ordering, 
 *     we would have an output sequence of [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
 *     
 *   - For the ordering of from-right-to-left(FILO),
 *     we insert the new element to the head of the queue,
 *     so that the element that comes late would get out first.
 *   - With the same input sequence of [1,2, 3, 4, 5],
 *     with FILO ordering,
 *     we would obtain an output sequence of [5, 4, 3, 2, 1].

/**
 * Time Complexity: O(N), where NN is the number of nodes in the tree.
 * 
 * - We visit each node once and only once.
 * - In addition, the insertion operation on either end of the deque takes a constant time, rather than using the array/list data structure where the inserting at the head could take the O(K) time where K is the length of the list.
 * 
 * Space Complexity: O(N) where N is the number of nodes in the tree.
 * 
 * - The main memory consumption of the algorithm is the node_queue that we use for the loop, apart from the array that we use to keep the final output.
 * 
 * - As one can see, at any given moment, the node_queue would hold the nodes that are at most across two levels. Therefore, at most, the size of the queue would be no more than 2â‹…L, assuming L is the maximum number of nodes that might reside on the same level. 
 * - Since we have a binary tree, the level that contains the most nodes could occur to consist all the leave nodes in a full binary tree, which is roughly L = N/2 
 * 
 * - As a result, we have the space complexity of 2* N/2 = N
 *   in the worst case.
